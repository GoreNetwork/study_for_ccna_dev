Git Branching work
git branch <branch name>: 				Create branch
git checkout <branch name>:  			Move to diffrent branch
git checkout -b <branch name>: 			Create new branch and move to it
(From master) git merge <branch name>:  Merge branch into master

Merge Conflict: Fix the issue, then re-commit and merge

git stash:  store your work when you aren't ready to commit it
git stash pop:  Removes the work from the stash, puts it in the file, and deletes the stash

(Demo is for me)
:Push to an empty repo:
	git remote add origin git@github.com:dhimes@gmail.com/<your_repo>.git
	git push -u origin master
	
Origin: an alias for the remote server
Master: the branch we are typing into
git push origin master:  Push the data
git pull origin master
